Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my journey in software development, with a special focus on AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

### AI-Assisted Development
How tools like Claude Code are transforming the way we write code, debug issues, and build features. I'll share practical tips, workflows, and real-world examples.

### Software Engineering Best Practices
Lessons learned from building production systems, including:
- Architecture patterns
- Testing strategies
- Code quality and maintainability
- Development workflows

### Developer Productivity
Tools, techniques, and workflows that make developers more effective, from editor configurations to CI/CD pipelines.

## Why Now?

We're at an inflection point in software development. AI tools are becoming capable enough to be true development partners, not just code completion engines. I want to explore this frontier and share what works.

## Stay Tuned

I'll be publishing regularly about my experiences, experiments, and discoveries. If you're interested in modern development practices and AI-assisted workflows, subscribe to the RSS feed or follow me on social media.

Let's build something great together!
