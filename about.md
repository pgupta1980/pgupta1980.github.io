- **Software Architecture** - Designing scalable, maintainable systems
- **Best Practices** - Sharing what works (and what doesn't) in real-world projects
- **Developer Tools** - Exploring and optimizing development workflows

This blog is my way of documenting what I learn, sharing knowledge with the community, and helping others navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted software development.
